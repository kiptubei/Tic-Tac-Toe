# Game Instructions (RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE)

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2. The first player is X, and the second player is O. Players take turns putting their marks in the numbered squares.

3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
